                    <p>One of the central concepts of finance is that <i>a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future</i>. Businesses and transactions operate on this principle every day.</p>

                    <p>For example, if you make a purchase with a credit card, interest is added to the bill to compensate the credit card company for lending you money. Conversely, if you deposit money in a savings account, the bank pays you interest to compensate you for lending them money.</p>

                    <p>It is important to understand the relationships between the variables that figure into TVM. Let's work through a scenario to establish the relationships underlying TVM:</p>
                    <p class="indent">You usually collect customer accounts at the end of the month, but one customer requests an extension. If you forego the payment for a while, you should be compensated for the delay.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="indent bold">What factors would you consider in determining how much the customer should pay at a later date?</p>

Now, identify the interest rate and the principal in the word problem by clicking on the variables below.
        
        
        How much money would you have in 1 year if you invested $100 at a rate of 10%
        
        n is the number of years. Look for time-related words like year or decade.
        
        The present value, or principal, is how much you have today. PV = $100
        
        Interest is a rate and is usually accompanied by a % sign. i = 10%

(100 * 10%) = 10 Calculated the 2nd year of interest by finding 10% of the 2nd year starting principal, $110. (110 * 10%) = 11 Added the 1st and 2nd year interest to the principal of $100. 100 + 10 + 11 = $121

        In other words, we calculated the interest earned in each individual year and added all the interest payments back to the principal to find the Future Value (FV). Although, this method does produce the correct answer, what would you do if asked for the future value after 100 years? You could create a spreadsheet of formulas with 100 interest payment calculations. However, it’s time-consuming and fortunately unnecessary. Instead, we’ll derive a general equation that will allow you to solve for Future Value (FV), Present Value (PV), interest rate (i), or number of years (n).

        Basic Princples of Algebra: Cancel out variables or numbers by doing the same thing (multiply, divide, raise to an exponent) on both sides of the equal sign. The reciprocal of a number is found by converting to a fraction and then switching the numerator and denominator. A number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. Therefore, reciprocals are useful for canceling numbers and exponents. Examples of reciprocals are:
        
        You’ll need to know the order of operations to understand the math that follows. Remember PEMDAS: Parentheses Exponents Multiplication and Division (from left to right) Addition and Subtraction (from left to right) You may have also learned this as: “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.”
        
        We will use the Distributive Property to distribute a number that is multiplied by a polynomial in parentheses. For instance:
        
        The Distributive Property is easy enough to understand when real numbers are involved. However, it’s important to understand how to distribute with variables.
        
        The FOIL Method is a systematic way to multiply terms inside parentheses. The letters stand for: First Outer Inner Last For instance:

        Now it’s just a matter of simplifying the formula and grouping like variables. [(PV * i)] + [(PV* i) + PV] * i + PV Start with the parentheses by multiplying the variables within.PVi + [PVi + PV] * i + PV Distribute the multiplication to the variables within the middle bracket.PVi + PVi2 + PVi + PV Group like variables.PVi + PVi2 + PVi + PV PVi2 + 2PVi + PV Use the distributive property to separate the like term, PV.PVi2 + 2PVi + PV PV(i2 + 2i + 1)

        5. The equation in the parentheses can be simpliefied to (x + 1)(x + 1). You may have seen this equation in the math help under FOIL 6. Think of (i + 1) as a number. A number multiplied by itself is also known as squaring that number, which is what we will do here. 7. Remember, back to the problem: the term is 2 years. Therefore, n = 2 and we can replace the number in the exponent with the variable.

        Adding FV to the other side of the equal sign, we arrive at: FV = PV(1 + i)n We could continue to derive the equation for 3, 10, or 100 years. After a lot of algebraic manipulation, the outcome would be the same. It’s not so important that you’re able to repeat the derivation, but that you understand the equation can be derived from individual calculations.

        "First, identify the variables from the problem: What would the $100 investment be worth in 10 years at 10%? PV = 100 FV = ? i = 10% or 0.10 n = 10 Did you come up with the right numbers? Here are some tips: i is a rate. Look for a percentage or decimal. n will be an expression of time; the number of years To distinguish between PV and FV, ask yourself whether the dollar amount is money you have now or in the future. Since the $100 is today’s investment, it must be PV. The question asks what it will be worth, indicating we want to find FV.

        FV = PV(1 + i)n
        
        FV = 100(1 + 0.10)10
        
        FV = 100(1.10)10
        
        2. Next, apply the exponent. Be careful about rounding.
        
        FV = 100(2.5937424601)

        In the problem we just solved, the number in parentheses (below) is called the Future Value factor. In the ‘good old days’ before calculators, people used tables of pre-calculated Future Value factors to solve the TVM equation. Find the intersection of the number of periods (years) on the left and the interest rate at the top to find the Future Value factor. Then multiply PV times the Future Value factor to calculate FV.
        
        FV = PV(Future Value factor FV = (100 * 2.5937) FV = $259.37

        So far we have calculated FV with the TVM equation and the Future Value Factor. A third way to calculate TVM is with a financial calculator. If you have a financial calculator, now would be a good time to make sure you know how to use it. Plug in the numbers to verify that the equation and calculator find the same FV. Answer this question: How much would the $100 grow in 10 years at 10%?
        
        Note: Your calculator must be on End mode -- this is the most common mistake made on tests. Also, notice that PV and FV are opposite signs (+/-).

        TVM: The BasicsEquation
        
        You have now solved the TVM equation for each of the 4 variables, proving that: If you know the general TVM equation and have some basic math skills, you can solve for any of the four variables. Therefore, we won’t go into the other 3 equations that you would otherwise have to memorize. You will have more opportunities to practice manipulating the equation in the Exercises section.

        It’s important that you grasp the basics of TVM before continuing on to the more advanced tutorials. To help you gauge your understanding of the TVM basics, you now have a chance to try some exercises on your own. For these individual exercises, do not use the TVM buttons on your financial calculator. All answers should include dollars and cents. Do not, however, enter commas (,) or symbols (% or $). For example, a properly formatted answer would be: 1150.38

        Answer: What interest rate (annual basis) is required for a deposit to double in 10 years? The problem states that we want to double the investment, which means FV will be twice the amount of PV. You can use any numbers, as long as you maintain as the FV to PV ratio is 2:1. However, to cut out the need to simplify the math later, it’s best to start with FV = 2 and PV = 1.
